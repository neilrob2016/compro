C/C++ Comment processor (Compro)
================================
A simple single pass, non tokenising parser that processes C and C++/C99
comments in a C/C++ source file.

Usage: compro
       -f <C/C++ file>  : Default = stdin
       -m <mode 1 to 6> : Default = 1
                             1 - Convert C comments to C++.
                             2 - Convert C++ comments to C.
                             3 - Output code (ie strip out comments).
                             4 - Output comments.
                             5 - Output comments with line numbers.
                             6 - Print a list of comment types and line numbers.
       -l               : Modified line processing in mode:
                             1 - With a multi line C comment attempt to indent
                                 the replacement C++ comments the same way.
                             2 - Merge multiple contiguous (seperated only by
                                 whitespace and a single newline) C++ comments
                                 into a single C comment.
                             3 - Don't output a blank line if there is only
                                 whitespace before a C++ comment on a line. Not
                                 implemented for C comments.
                             4 - Print the entire line the comment is on (ie
                                 include program text).
                             5 - As mode 4.
                             6 - No effect.
       -x               : Extra info in mode:
                             5 - Print line numbers for every line of a multi
                                 line C comment instead of just the first.
                             6 - Print header and footer.
                          No effect in other modes.
       -h               : Print this usage.
       -v               : Print version and build info then exit.
Note:
   - All arguments are optional.
   - All output goes to stdout except errors which go to stderr.

Input is from stdin or a source file given with the -f option. Output is to
stdout, errors to stderr. This has been compiled and tested on Linux and MacOS
though there's nothing specific to either and it just uses standard Posix calls
so should compile on other versions of *nix too.

Compilation: Type "make"
