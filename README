C/C++ Comment processor (Compro)
================================
A simple single pass, non tokenising parser that processes C and C++/C99
comments in a C/C++ source file.

There are 6 output modes:
   1 - Convert C comments to C++
   2 - Convert C++ comments to C
   3 - Output code (ie strip out comments)
   4 - Output comments
   5 - Output comments with line numbers
   6 - Print a list of comment types and line numbers

Input is from stdin or a source file given with the -f option. Output is to
stdout, errors to stderr. This has been compiled and tested on Linux and MacOS
though there's nothing specific to either and it just uses standard Posix calls
so should compile on other versions of *nix too.

Compilation: Type "make"
